# Roblox Web Launcher for macOS

## About

A web app I designed for people to launch Roblox games because Firefox for macOS never launches Roblox properly.

You can login to the application and launch whatever game you play.

The application quits when you close the window, so i recommend you to minimize the application if you don't want it to show up on your desktop.

## Installation

[Click here](https://github.com/raymond-1227/roblox-web-launcher/releases/latest) to download the zip file which includes the app itself.

Just execute the app and login to your Roblox account as usual. Have fun!

## Note

This application has only been tested on my Mac, running macOS Big Sur 11.5.2 (Intel Variant), and it's completely safe.

Since I'm not paying Apple to sign my application, so you must reopen the application from `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General` and click on `Open Anyway`. (You'll only have to do this once after you download)
